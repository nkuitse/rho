rho - move data in rows from database to database

A rho report consists of one or more steps.  Each step is a pair of SQL
statements -- one to extract rows of data from one database, the other to write
the rows to another database.  ("rho" = "row" respelled.)

For example, the first step (a "reader") might gather recent sales data from
one DB and write a summary to another DB.

A rho "report" for this purpose might be defined like this:

    db sales {
        dsn "dbi:Oracle:..."
        user "log_user"
        password "********"
    }
    db stats {
        dsn "dbi:mysql:..."
        user "stats"
        password "********"
    }
    read from sales {
        SELECT  COUNT(*), SUM(total), AVG(total), category
        FROM    sales
        WHERE   timestamp >= SYSDATE() - 7
        GROUP BY category;
    }
    write to stats {
        INSERT INTO monthly_sales (num_sales, total_amount, avg_amount, category, time_period)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, <$period>);
    }
    parameters {
        period required type date description "Time period";
    }

The placeholder "<$period>" in the writer will be filled in by an argument that
must be supplied on the command line.  To run the report:

    $ rho FILE period=201810/P1M

The most obvious use for this is as one part in a complete report-generating
system -- other parts might create a spreadsheet from the resulting database,
for example -- but you may be able to think of other uses.
